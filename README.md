# Colorado-Financial-Landscape
This repository : An exploratory project looking to gain insight into the landscape of income in CO as well as existing Estate planning firms.


Posibble Data Sources: Census, SEC.gov, IRS data

Key points to be covered with analysis:

-What cities in CO are most favorable demographically for the expansion of a financial planning/registered investment advisory firm?

-Number of adults in age tiers – 20-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70 and >80.  Any measure of private school enrollment?

-In which counties is average wealth the highest (ideally excluding home value)?  Average income?

-Is there a way to tell if this is primary or secondary residence (i.e. vacation home versus home)?

-Overlay concentration of Registered Investment Advisory Firms – another overlay showing concentration of Trust Companies and another overlay showing banks and/or brokerage firms.


-Registered Investment Advisory Firms would be most clearly our competition and also provide more potential for “lift out” mergers/acquisitions.

-Potential Clients = Wealth - $3M or greater and/or average income >$400K, Age 35-65

Let's break it down before writing a single line of code. 

One small step at a time:
-Create README.md with goals clearly stated.
-With our goals in mind: Figure out the variables we are most interested in performing analysis on.(What would our -dataframes/tables optimally look like before we do anything visually fancy or begin with any sort of statistical analysis). 
-Begin the process of identifying potential sources for this data and vetting them for quality. 
-Harvest data 
-Calculate our desired variables if they are not already in existance. 
-Apply the appropriate statistical analysis. 
-Create all desired tables, perform statistical analysis and create graphics.
-Organize all wrangled data, graphics in a jupyter notebook. 
-Create a dashboard using bootstrap or react framework. 
-Identify what further research could/should be done down the road which currently exists out of scope for the purposes of this project.
