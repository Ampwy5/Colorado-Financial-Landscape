# Colorado-Financial-Landscape
This repository : An exploratory project looking to gain insight into the landscape of income in CO as well as existing Estate planning firms.

Let's break it down before writing a single line of code. 
Initializing:
-Create README.md with goals clearly stated.
-With our goals in mind: Figure out the variables we are most interested in performing analysis on.(What would our -dataframes/tables optimally look like before we do anything visually fancy or begin with any sort of statistical analysis). 
-Begin the process of identifying potential sources for this data and vetting them for quality. 
-Harvest data 
-Calculate our desired variables if they are not already in existance. 
-Apply the appropriate statistical analysis. 
-Finalize project by creating user friendly notebook. 
-Identify what further research could/should be done down the road which currently exists out of scope for the purposes of this project. 

Questions to be answered before beginning:

What do we consider to be a potential client? 


What avg income found in an area would represent an area with potential clients?


What do we classify a firm as representing competition? Is this any business that would be classified as a "financial" firm or is there a more specific way of defining the competition that would help us to not cloud our data? 


What demographics are we really interested in? eg. age?
